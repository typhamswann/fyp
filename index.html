            </h2>
        <div class="blurb-3"><p>To introduce the class of 2027 to the Brown community, The Herald conducted its first-ever poll of the incoming first-year class between July 26 and August 7. The poll’s questions spanned topics including intended concentrations, relationship status, substance use and political views.
            <br><br>
            The Herald distributed its survey via email and received 710 responses, representing approximately 40% of the incoming first-year class. All questions, except for those asking about demographics, were optional, and all responses have been de-identified. Only accounts with Brown email domains were able to submit the form, but no addresses were recorded.
            <br><br>
            With 53,730 data points analyzed, the poll represents the most comprehensive look at the first-year class to date. While some of the most notable findings can be found below, our interactive site offers further data exploration.
            <br><br>
            Continue reading to get to know more about the class of 2027 as they bring their diverse views, life experiences and backgrounds to campus.

            <i>Note: With smaller sample sizes, the likelihood of misrepresenting certain groups in a cross tabulation increases. The Herald’s goal is to minimize the risk of representing any group inaccurately, so we omitted/combined certain populations from which we did not collect enough responses.</i></p></div>

The most common states of residence among first-year students are New York, California, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Texas. Wyoming and Nevada are the only states not represented in the first-year class, Associate Provost for Enrollment Logan Powell wrote in an email to The Herald.</p></div>

                About 63% of incoming first-year students identify as straight — roughly the same percentage as the current student body, according to findings from The Herald’s spring 2023 poll. Thirty-seven percent do not identify as straight, compared to the 20.8% of similarly aged Americans.
                <br><br>
                The most common identity among those in the LGBTQ+ community is bisexual, at 15% of total respondents, followed closely by unsure or questioning at 6%. Current Brunonians have identified as questioning at similar rates in recent years, according to an analysis of previous Herald polling data.
                <br><br>
                The gender gap between respondents is stark, with nearly 20% more women than men identifying as not straight. Four times as many women as men identify as bisexual, representing almost a quarter of female first-year students. Male first-year students are twice as likely to identify as gay than bisexual.            </div>

        <div class="blurb"><p>Roughly one-fifth of incoming first-year students are in a committed long-term relationship, with an additional 8% reporting that they are in a casual relationship. An equal percentage of current Brown students reported being in a casual relationship in The Herald’s fall 2022 poll with the Brown Opinion Project, though a slightly larger percent (25%) were in a long-term relationship.
            <br><br>
            A larger share of single male respondents said that they are looking for something casual than of single female respondents, while more single female respondents reported not looking for anything.

                A little over one-third of first-year respondents reported having had sex, a share which remains consistent for both straight and non-straight students. But recruited athletes are much more likely to have had sex at 63% — nearly twice the share of non-recruited athletes who reported having had sex.
                <br><br>
                Of the poll’s listed substances, alcohol was the most commonly tried by respondents, with two-thirds reporting having tried alcohol. Next was marijuana, tried by one-third of respondents, followed by nicotine at 20%.
                <br><br>
                The vast majority of first-year students reported that they do not have a fake form of identification, with only about 14% of respondents saying that they possess one. Frequency of alcohol use was correlated with likelihood of having a fake ID, with nearly 40% of those who consume alcohol at least once per week reporting having one.

Employment varied slightly when accounting for financial aid status: Almost 70% of first-year students receiving grants covering some costs reported holding a paying job, compared to 54% of those receiving no financial aid and 58% of those receiving grants covering all costs.</p></div>

            <div class="blurb-2" id="ideology"> <!-- Blurb div -->
                An overwhelming share of first-year respondents reported holding liberal political views, with 30% and 42% describing their political ideology as very or somewhat liberal, respectively. An additional 17% identified as moderate, with just over 6% identifying as somewhat or very conservative. The first-year class is significantly more liberal than the American public, as a 2021 Gallup survey found only 34% of Americans aged 18 to 29 identified as liberal.
                <br><br>
                Female respondents were more likely to be liberal, with 79% identifying as very or somewhat liberal compared to 62% of men. Asian respondents were least likely to report holding very liberal views and most likely to hold somewhat liberal or moderate political views.
                <br><br>
                Political ideology also varied by legacy and socioeconomic status. First-year students whose parents attended Brown identified as liberal at much higher rates, with 93% holding very liberal or somewhat liberal political views — a statistic that could be explained by the influential role that a person’s upbringing can have in developing a political ideology.
                <br><br>
                Self-identified upper-class respondents were the least likely to report being very liberal and most likely to be somewhat or very conservative, while middle-class respondents tended to be the most moderate.
                <br><br>
                International students are less likely to identify as very liberal, with only 14% reporting to hold such views.</div>

                When asked whether they believe socialism is a preferable economic system to capitalism, first-year students were largely split in their responses. The 38% of respondents who said they strongly or somewhat agree with the statement is less than the 44% of Americans aged 18 to 29 who reported having a very or somewhat positive impression of socialism in a 2022 Pew Research Center survey.
                <br><br>
                Support for socialism decreased with self-reported socioeconomic status and increased with financial aid.
                <br><br>
                Among survey respondents, those who identified as Black were much more likely to strongly or somewhat agree with the statement, at 56%, while Asian respondents were much less likely, with only 30% strongly or somewhat agreeing.

Nearly half of all respondents are unsure whether they will pursue a double concentration or certificate.
            <br><br>
            Of respondents planning to pursue a higher degree after graduation, those planning to pursue a JD or PhD were most likely to double concentrate, at 52% and 49% respectively.

                Approximately half of the 1,700 students in the incoming class were admitted via early decision, leaving the remainder of the spots to be filled by applicants from regular decision, Questbridge and the University’s Resumed Undergraduate Education program.
                <br><br>
                But different types of applicants were more likely to apply early decision — those who had a parent or sibling attend the University were about 30% more likely to apply early. 
                <br><br>
                The share of first-generation students who applied by the November deadline was half that of students whose parents attended college. First-generation respondents were also 27 times more likely to apply through the Questbridge program.
                <br><br>
                Eighty-five percent of first-year varsity athletes applied during the early decision round, which is common practice in athletic recruitment.

                The first-year students matriculating into Brown this fall are likely enthusiastic about their enrollment, as three-quarters of incoming students indicated that Brown was their top choice during the admissions process.
                <br><br>
                As early decision applicants are contractually bound to attend the University, first-year students who were admitted through early decision were nearly unanimous in reporting that Brown was their top choice.
                <br><br>
                Among students who applied regular decision, almost 40% reported that Brown was their top choice. Questbridge applicants, who rank colleges based on personal preferences and are subsequently matched with an institution, were evenly split on if Brown was their top choice.

                Across students who did and did not think of Brown as their top choice, other Ivy League colleges were among the top choice institutions for many, with Yale, Harvard and Columbia leading the pack. Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology also rank highly among students shooting for these elite colleges. In the 607 responses received, only 67 unique alternative colleges were indicated as dream schools.
<br><br>
But this was before students received their admission decisions. After those applying regular decision received their acceptances, their back-up colleges changed dramatically, with most of the previous dream institutions falling much lower on the list.
<br><br>
Instead, Northeastern University, University of California Berkeley and University of California, Los Angeles topped the list, and Cornell University, Duke University and Georgetown University trailed closely behind. As students decided which of the 85 substitute colleges they would ultimately enroll in, these other highly-ranked colleges ultimately fell second to Brown.
